### 💼 Leadership Philosophy

I believe in being an approachable manager and a [human-first leader](#). My focus is on empowering teams to innovate, deliver, and grow in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

## 💫 Inspiration

This site is inspired by the work and writing style of [Ben Balter](https://ben.balter.com/), Director of Hubber Enablement within the Office of the COO at GitHub. I particularly appreciate his detailed, thoughtful posts on GitHub culture, such as [The seven habits of highly effective GitHubbers](https://ben.balter.com/2016/09/13/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-githubbers/), which provides valuable insights into GitHub's unique work culture through traits like:

- Professional, but not formal
- Ship early, ship often
- If you see something, say something
- Curiosity and self-improvement
- Always be willing to help
- Contribute to the appreciation economy
- Honesty, integrity, and authenticity

Ben's approach to transparent, human-centric technical writing has greatly influenced how I structure my own posts and share my experiences.

## How to Add a New Blog Post

With Jekyll, adding a new blog post is simple:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-hyphens.md`
2. Add the YAML front matter at the top of the file with the required metadata:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: "David O'Regan"
authorImage: "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4388753?s=400&u=56053676f0fe2eb4d7f6986a022f2becc8279a0e&v=4"
image: "URL-to-your-header-image"
imageAlt: "Description of the image for accessibility"
excerpt: "A brief excerpt of your blog post that will appear in previews..."
readTime: "X min read"
description: "SEO-friendly description of your post"
---

Your blog post content goes here, written in Markdown.
```

3. Write your blog post content in Markdown below the front matter
4. Commit and push to GitHub - your post will be automatically published!

## Writing Tips

- Use Markdown headings (`##` for H2, `###` for H3, etc.)
- Include images with `![Alt text](image-url)`
- Create links with `[Link text](URL)`
- Use code blocks with triple backticks
- Create blockquotes with `>`
- Create lists with `-` or `1.` for numbered lists

## Local Development

If you want to preview changes locally (optional):

1. Install Ruby and Bundler
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the development server
4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser

## Site Structure

- `_posts/`: Contains all blog posts as Markdown files
- `_layouts/`: Contains the HTML templates for different page types
- `_includes/`: Contains reusable HTML components
- `_config.yml`: Main configuration file for Jekyll
- `assets/images/`: Store images here
- `css/`: Contains stylesheets

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch using the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`.
